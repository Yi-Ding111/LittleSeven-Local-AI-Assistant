First, compute the semi-perimeter \\\\(s\\\\):\\n\\n   \\\\[\\n   s = \\\\frac{a + b + c}{2}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n   Then the area \\\\(A\\\\) is given by:\\n\\n   \\\\[\\n   A = \\\\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. **Using Trigonometry**:\\n   If you know two sides and the included angle, you can use:\\n\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\text{Area} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times a \\\\times b \\\\times \\\\sin(C)\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n   Here, \\\\(a\\\\) and \\\\(b\\\\) are the lengths of the two sides, and \\\\(C\\\\) is the measure of the included angle.\\n\\n### Real-World Applications\\nCalculating the area of a triangle is important in various fields, including architecture, engineering, and geography for land surveying and more.\\n\\nFeel free to ask if you would like to know more about any of these methods!\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),\n",
